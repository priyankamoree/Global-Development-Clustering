## Global Development Clustering Analysis
This project involves clustering countries or regions based on global development indicators such as GDP, literacy rates, life expectancy, and infrastructure metrics. By grouping similar entities, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and aid in targeted decision-making for development initiatives.

**Key Objectives:**
Identify clusters of countries/regions with shared development metrics.
Provide actionable insights to prioritize interventions.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python

**Libraries:**
pandas and numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
scikit-learn for clustering

**Tools:**
Jupyter Notebook

**Methodology**
- Data Preprocessing:
    Handle missing values and normalize features.
    Feature Selection:
    Metrics such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, literacy rates, etc.
  
**Clustering Algorithms:**
K-Means: For partitioning countries into distinct clusters.
Hierarchical Clustering: To visualize cluster hierarchies using dendrograms.
DBSCAN: For finding the noise data.

**Evaluation:**
Silhouette Score and Elbow Method,Dendograms and Epsilon value to validate cluster quality.

**Results**
Cluster Insights: Each cluster represents regions with shared development characteristics.
Visualization: Heatmaps, dendrograms, and scatter plots illustrate clustering patterns.

**How to Run**
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Global-Development-Clustering.git
cd Global-Development-Clustering

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Code
Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook clustering_analysis.ipynb

step 4: Deploying Your Streamlit App
- Install Streamlit (if you haven't already)
  pip install streamlit
    
- Run Locally for Testing
  streamlit run app.py
